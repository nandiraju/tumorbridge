    <p>The implementation of AI-powered virtual tumor boards (VTBs) for oncologists has shown significant potential to
      improve cancer care. Here are some key statistics highlighting the need for such systems:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Access to Expertise:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>66% of rural counties in the United States have no oncologist[7].</li>
      <li>56% of Veterans who received cancer care through the VA National TeleOncology service in 2022 lived in rural
        areas[7].</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Efficiency and Scalability:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>The median turnaround time for personalized reports decreased from 14 days to 4 days over 4 years using a
        cloud-based VTB platform[6].</li>
      <li>Case volume increased nearly 2-fold each year with the implementation of a VTB system[6].</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Improved Decision-Making:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>A machine learning algorithm accurately predicted all eight treatment recommendations made by a
        multidisciplinary tumor board for hepatocellular carcinoma patients[5].</li>
      <li>The AI model’s predictions were more accurate than those based on published therapeutic guidelines by ESMO and
        NCCN[5].</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="4">
      <li>Impact on Patient Care:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>44% of patients with a confirmed treatment preferred the VTB integrated option in one study[3].</li>
      <li>Virtual tumor boards improved the accuracy of treatment decision-making for patients with advanced lung cancer
        and significantly reduced the time required to initiate treatment[10].</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="5">
      <li>Multidisciplinary Collaboration:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>VTBs typically involve a median of 5 specialists, including neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiation
        oncologists, molecular pathologists, and neuroradiologists[2].</li>
      <li>Doctor attendance increased by 46% during virtual meetings compared to face-to-face tumor boards[10].</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These statistics demonstrate the potential of AI-powered VTBs to address challenges in cancer care, particularly
      in rural and underserved areas, while improving efficiency, decision-making, and patient outcomes.</p>
