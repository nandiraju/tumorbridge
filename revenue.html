  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>A <strong>virtual tumor board (VTB)</strong> generates revenue through several business models, depending on its structure and target market. Here are some common ways VTBs make money:</p>
<h3 id="subscription-model">1. <strong>Subscription Model</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hospitals, clinics, and oncology centers pay a <strong>monthly or annual subscription fee</strong> to access the VTB platform.</li>
<li>Different pricing tiers may be offered based on the number of cases discussed, features, or AI-powered decision support.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pay-per-case--consultation-fees">2. <strong>Pay-Per-Case / Consultation Fees</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare providers or individual oncologists pay a <strong>fee per tumor board session</strong> or <strong>per case review</strong>.</li>
<li>This model is useful for smaller hospitals that may not need regular tumor board meetings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software-licensing">3. <strong>Software Licensing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hospitals and cancer centers <strong>license the VTB software</strong> for internal use.</li>
<li>The platform can be <strong>integrated with hospital systems (EHR, PACS, etc.)</strong>, ensuring seamless data exchange.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ai-assisted-decision-support-services">4. <strong>AI-Assisted Decision Support Services</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>AI-powered tumor boards can <strong>charge for premium features</strong>, such as:
<ul>
<li>AI-driven recommendations based on treatment protocols.</li>
<li>Predictive analytics for personalized treatment plans.</li>
<li>Integration with genomic data and clinical trials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pharmaceutical--clinical-trial-sponsorships">5. <strong>Pharmaceutical &amp; Clinical Trial Sponsorships</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Drug companies and clinical trial organizations can <strong>sponsor the VTB</strong> in exchange for:
<ul>
<li>Insights into real-world oncology case discussions.</li>
<li>Opportunities to suggest eligible patients for trials.</li>
<li>Promotion of new therapies (within ethical and regulatory limits).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="insurance--reimbursement-partnerships">6. <strong>Insurance &amp; Reimbursement Partnerships</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, VTB services can be <strong>reimbursed by insurance providers</strong>, especially if the board’s recommendations improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary treatments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-monetization--insights">7. <strong>Data Monetization &amp; Insights</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Aggregated, anonymized data from tumor board discussions can be used for:
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical research</strong> (sold to universities, pharmaceutical companies, or AI startups).</li>
<li><strong>AI model training</strong> (used to improve cancer diagnostics and treatment recommendations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="continuing-medical-education-cme--training">8. <strong>Continuing Medical Education (CME) &amp; Training</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Offer <strong>paid CME-accredited courses</strong> for oncologists, radiologists, and pathologists.</li>
<li>Provide <strong>training subscriptions</strong> for hospitals to improve their cancer care teams.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integration--white-label-solutions">9. <strong>Integration &amp; White-Label Solutions</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some companies <strong>offer VTB technology as a white-label product</strong> for large hospital networks or healthcare providers, charging a fee for customization and integration.</li>
</ul>
